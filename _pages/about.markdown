We're a WiiConnect24 replacement intended to be a better fit for the community and developers than other WiiConnect24 replacements. The name was provided by Twin_Turbo (@Twin_Turbo#8726 on Discord) -- thanks to them!
Our Discord server can be found at \<coming soon>  

<br>

Current project status: in heavy initial development.
We plan to have:
- Mail, EVC voting, announcement services provided by Google App Engine
- Serving of static forecast, news, evc data soon off of either flexible App Engine or Compute Engine.
