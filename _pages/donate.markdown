Disconnect24's donation model is designed to ensure that all donations towards DC24 will stay within the ecosystem of itself and/or relatives.

<br>

**Donations are used on...**
- VPS Upkeep

> The VPS isn't provided free and as a result, part of your donation goes to paying the rent of the VPS.

- Service Upkeep

> Service Upkeep is a broad term for the projects that are built in Disconnect24's organisation.

**Donations are NOT used on...**
- Marketing

> Advertising and/or marketing of Disconnect24 is not funded by donations. We advertise Disconnect24 out of our own wallets, not others.

- Personal Use

> We forbid personal use of our services as that is directly linked to the donation funding of the community.

- Closed-Source Projects

> We only allow a 30-day period for a developer that uses our services for their project to open-source their work or they'll have their files backed up and removed from the service. (They will receive the backup copy of their files.)

If you'd like to donate, please let us know on our Discord server.
