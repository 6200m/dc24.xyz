Hey guys.

This is going to be the last announcement for Disconnect24. As of July 1, 2018 the Disconnect24 servers have expired. The original
developers of this project have moved on, including myself and founder Spotlight. The servers have still been running but the project is
now owned by Larsenv, the owner of RiiConnect24. Since there are no longer any exclusive DC24 developers, the project is being shut down.
The server costs simply wouldn't be worthwhile if the project no longer has any purpose and has few to no users left.

The work we put into Disconnect24 isn't gone to waste, though. A lot of our code has been merged into RiiConnect24; so when you use
RiiConnect24, remember us! Additionally, our code on GitHub will still be available and as open-sourced as ever, so if you feel like
checking it out, you will still be free to do so after the shutdown.

So on behalf of the Disconnect24 team, we would like to thank all of our users, testers and developers for their time and effort put into
this project. It was a good run and for us, we gained a lot from this project - we learned many things from this project which we can
take away from this. 

It was a good run, and we hope you enjoyed using Disconnect24 and having discussions with us developers. I know we did.
